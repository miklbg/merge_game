# Setup Instructions

## Quick Start

**No build or installation required!** Just open the game and play.

### Option 1: Open Directly (Simplest)
```bash
# Navigate to the game directory
cd game

# Open in your browser (choose your preferred method):
open index.html           # macOS
start index.html          # Windows
xdg-open index.html       # Linux
```

Or simply double-click `game/index.html` in your file explorer.

### Option 2: Local Web Server (Recommended)

For the best experience and to avoid any potential browser file:// protocol restrictions:

```bash
# Navigate to the game directory
cd game

# Start a simple HTTP server
python3 -m http.server 8080
# or
python -m http.server 8080

# Then open in your browser:
# http://localhost:8080
```

Alternative servers:
```bash
# Using Node.js
npx http-server -p 8080

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8080
```

## 🎮 First Launch

1. Open `game/index.html` using one of the methods above
2. Click the **"Start"** button to begin playing
3. The game will load with background music (browser may require interaction first)
4. Your game progress and high scores are automatically saved to localStorage

## 📦 What's Included

All dependencies are included - no installation needed:
- **Tailwind CSS** - Pre-built CSS included locally in `game/css/tailwind.min.css`

### Development Setup (Optional)

If you want to modify Tailwind styles, you'll need Node.js and npm:
