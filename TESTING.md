# Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to test the Fruit Merge Game. The game is a self-contained HTML/CSS/JavaScript application with no build process or external test framework.

## Quick Test

**Fastest way to verify the game works:**
```bash
# Open the game
open game/index.html  # macOS
# or
start game/index.html  # Windows
# or
xdg-open game/index.html  # Linux
```

## Local Server Testing (Recommended)

For the most reliable testing experience:

**Option 1: Python**
```bash
cd game
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Visit: http://localhost:8080
```

**Option 2: Node.js**
```bash
cd game
npx http-server -p 8080
# Visit: http://localhost:8080
```
